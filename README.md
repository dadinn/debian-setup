Debian setup
============

Sets up a new Debian operating system.

1. Run `debinst.sh` on a computer with a newly formatted hard drive.
2. Once the script finished running, you'll find yourself logged in as the `root` user. Execute the script `/debconf.sh` with custom arguments, e.g. `/debconf.sh -s myusername -n myhostname -k us`
3. Once all done, simply restart the computer and boot into your new system.
